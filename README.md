# Aces Up Solitaire Solver
I previously hadn't found any results on the solvability of Aces Up, except for the wikipedia quote that "Winning chances with good play are about 1 in 43".

It seems that the solvability for any given shuffle is a lot higher (over 22%). Will update the readme when I get done and can run a huge sample and collect statistics.
